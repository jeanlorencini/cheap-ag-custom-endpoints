!`npx -y github:jeanlorencini/cheap-ag-custom-endpoints#main clean $ARGUMENTS`

Report the result above to the user in one or two lines.

If no output appears above (Codex): run that command yourself once, exactly as written, with `$ARGUMENTS` replaced by whatever the user typed after the skill name (or nothing). It needs network for npx; ask for that if the sandbox blocks it.
